BIRT (Business Intelligence Reporting Tools) is an open source Eclipse-based set of reporting and data visualization tools and technologies used to build rich information applications, in particular, web applications based on Java and J2EE.


The 

&lt;B&gt;

Native Excel Emitter Plugin

&lt;/B&gt;

 for Birt allows you to generate reports in MS Excel 2003 and 2007 (Binary Format).

Following are the advantages:

1) Provides report in Native(Binary) MS Excel Format 

&lt;BR&gt;


2) Supports 2003 & 2007 ( So far, None of the excel emitter supports MS excel 2007 ) 

&lt;BR&gt;


3) Images Support 

&lt;BR&gt;


4) Multiple Sheets Support 

&lt;BR&gt;


5) Report File Size is less, compare to other available emitters (like Default Birt XLS emitter).

&lt;BR&gt;




Note:
This is extended from the Default Birt XLS Emitter "org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.emitter.prototype.excel\_2.6.2.r262\_v20110215".
